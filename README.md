# PCA-on-1000-Genomes-Project
In this project, I've performed PCA on the 1000 genomes project. Feel free to play around with the code and make changes. This is not a very efficient code but does the job anyways. If you think some changes are required, feel free to message/mail me or if you need help, I'll try my best.

I've included both files, i.e python and ipynb, use whichever you want to (there's no difference in the code though) and I've also included the raw data file i.e p1dataset2021.
Since the data wasn't numerical, I had to convert it to binary and use it. If you want to use the raw data file, you'll need to do the same.

Have fun.
Cheers!
